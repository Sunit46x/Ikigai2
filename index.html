                        As a school principal, understanding all these
                        details has also transformed how I approach
                        nutrition for the kids. The way you ve helped me
                        rethink my own health and diet has given me
                        fresh insights on how important it is to educate
                        children on building healthier eating habits for
                        life. Thank you so much for that.

                        I remember you telling me that this isnt just a
                        diet but a lifestyle we re building, and honestly, I
                        didnt fully get it at first. But now, every time I eat
                        something, I automatically think about how it will
                        affect my body, my skin, and my overall health.
                        That mindset shift has been huge for me! Even
                        with occasional cheat meals, my weight has
                        stayed consistent, and I can feel that my
                        hormonal imbalances have reduced a lot-which
                        is so clear from my skin and my regular periods

            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>
                At Ikigai Integrative Healthcare, we believe that healing isn’t a destination, it’s a rhythm your body
                remembers.
                Founded by Dr. Priyanka Gavhane (Anurati), a trained Ayurvedic physician and integrative health
                consultant, Ikigai was born from a simple yet powerful question:
                What if medicine treated the person, not just the symptom?
            </p>

            <p>
                After years of working in conventional clinics, Dr. Anurati realized that something critical was
                missing, a structured, daily, root-cause approach that could bridge
                ancient Ayurvedic wisdom with the precision of modern diagnostics. Hormonal imbalances, metabolic
                disorders, chronic fatigue, these conditions weren’t just biological events;
                they were disruptions in rhythm, nourishment, and clarity.<br>
                That’s where Ikigai began.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ikigai means <strong>“a reason for being.”</strong> And for us, that means walking with each client
                through every phase of healing,
                using Ayurvedic tools like prakriti, agni, ojas alongside hormone mapping, micronutrient profiling,
                gut-brain regulation, and meal-by-meal support.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, Ikigai is more than a clinic. It’s a lifestyle lab. A place where PCOS isn’t just managed, it’s
                reversed. Where postnatal bodies are understood, not judged.
                Where real food becomes medicine, not through trends, but through tradition and science.<br>
                Our story is not just about medicine. It’s about restoring rhythm. And we’re just getting started.

                    <p>
                        As the founder of Ikigai Integrative Healthcare, I built this platform to bridge the gap between
                        symptom-focused care and root-cause healing. With over 7 years of clinical experience
                        managing metabolic and hormonal imbalances, I’ve seen how traditional compartmentalised
                        systems often fall short when it comes to long-term recovery.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Rooted in Ayurveda. Enhanced by modern science.
                        Ikigai represents a clinically structured approach where Ayurvedic principles like Prakriti,
                        Agni,
                        and Ojas are integrated with functional tools hormone panels, micronutrient tracking, metabolic
                        profiling, and lifestyle pattern analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Food is not just fuel. It’s data.
                        I believe your body is designed to heal when given the right information and rhythm. Through
                        personalised therapeutic nutrition, consistent habit design, and daily check-ins, I help clients
                        realign their biology, one layer at a time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I walk with every client, daily.
                        Whether you re healing PCOS, navigating post-pregnancy metabolism, or reversing early-stage
                        diabetes, I’m here not just as a doctor, but as a committed partner in your transformation.
